## Arrays in Python

### Overview

Just kidding! Python doesn't have arrays.

Instead, it has a few different types of collections (a collection being, conceptually, a single "variable" used to store multiple values).

#### Lists

A __list__ is an ordered, mutable collection of items.
+ Duplicate items are permitted.
+ Items can be modified, replaced, or removed.
+ The order in which items are added is maintained.
+ Items are accessed via indices.
+ Mixed types can be stored in the same list.

A list can be created using
+ Square brackets: ```a = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]```
+ List constructors: ```b = list("GFG")```
+ Multiplication operators: ```c = [0] * 7```
